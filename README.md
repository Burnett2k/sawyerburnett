# Personal website

experimenting with building a person site with a static site generator.

Create a new project:

```bash
$ react-static create
```

Navigate to your new project:

```bash
$ cd my-static-site
```

5.  Start the dev server and edit some code!

```bash
$ yarn start # or react-static start
```

6.  Test a production build

```bash
$ yarn stage # or react-static build --staging
$ yarn serve
```

6.  Build for production!

```bash
$ yarn build # or react-static build
```

to get material-ui installed:

yarn add @material-ui/core

install react jss
